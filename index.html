		<div>Understanding the Covid pandemic
The purpose of the Covid game is not entertainment but understanding, specifically understanding the Covid pandemic.
 We now live in a Covid world and to do so successfully requires rational actions based on informed  understanding of the disease. Thoughtful use of the Covid game may help you achieve this understanding and successful strategies for dealing with it.
Taking individual action can be successful in containing the disease but has physical, psychological and social costs. 
Collective action is required to control outbreaks but you can only control your actions not those of others. 
Covid changes. What works today may not work tomorrow. You must also change.
These are just a few things you may learn as you play the game. There are many more.
So play the game but consider what you do and the results. The lives of all us, even you depend on individual actions
How to Play the GameThe  game will choose your role and risk level.Your risk level is determined by how old you are, where you live, what's your ethnic makeup etc
Every time there is a outbreak your risk level determines how likely you are to get it and how sick you will be if you do get it
The game consists of five rounds in which you make choices as to how you are going to deal with covid.
Your first choice is to decide whether to rely on fate or to take an active role in how you will respond to covid
If you choose fate you are letting chance determine your response. Choosing Faith does not require you to make any changes and thus does not cost you any resources
Taking an active role gives you a number of choices you can take on how you will respond. Taking an active role however means you must act and thus costs you resources. There is a correlation between the dificulty of the action, the cost of the action nd the cost of the action.
Your goal in the game is to contain covid. If you have an outbreak your risk of getting sick increases. If you get covid the seriousness of the outcome is determined by the risk assessment giving you at the beginning of the round.
A round ends when you have chosen fate by clicking the fate or activated your individual choicesbyx clicking the action button. The computer then determines the result.You will then go on to the next round by clicking the next round button which resets the board. 
You can continue to make active choices in how you deal with covid as long as you have resources left. Once you have used up all your resources this game still continues but you no longer have an active role in how you deal with covid.Your goal in the game and in each round is to not get sick. Once you have gotten sick your fate will be determined by your risk factors and the game ends.The overall goal of the game is to stay healthy for 5 rounds using the least amount of resources you can.

You start with 20 covid resources. These resources represent what you give up in terms of psychic discomfort income or social discomfort to make the choices you make
When you have used all your resources you can no longer take an active role in containing covid.
Covid-19 escapesYour Chance of exposure increasesYou can get lucky and escape the disease
If you get sick and  lose both time, rounds, and resources or you die and the game ends



 Steps in in a roundChoosing fate or action               Choosing fate wipes all action from the boards and leaves you result to chanceChoosing Actions                  Each action cost you resources                  When you are ready to act hit the ACTION button                    Containing the virus depends on the which action buttons you exercise
A Round ends whenever you choose Fate or take action. The results are listed in the boxes and the new round begins. A round is operational as long as covid is contained. You'll know if it's contained by what it does (goes round and round or goes out of the box. Once it's out of the box orcontained the results are calculated and you can begin a new round by clicking the next round button.
If you run out of resources Fate will be your only option
Personal risk factor determines outcome once you are exposedCommunity risk factor determines odds of covid escaping

How did you play the game?(Which of the following strategies did you use)

Risk taker I'm lucky and even if there is an outbreak I probably won't get it or if I do it won't die and plus I don't have to think

Do a little I'll do something as long as it doesn't cost too much.

Whatever it takes. I'll do whatever I can as long to contain covid
Survival I'll be judicious in my choices in to survive the game

Reactive mode. Limited or no resources robbed me of options
